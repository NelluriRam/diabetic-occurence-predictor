# diabetic-occurence-predictor
We gathered information on age, body measurements, and medical history in order to develop a tool to predict diabetes risk. We trained a computer to predict diabetes risk using logistic regression. Our project intends to assist in early risk identification of individuals, enabling prompt interventions for improved healthcare management.
